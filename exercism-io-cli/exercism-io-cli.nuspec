    <description>
Exercism is all about having conversations about code. In order to start having those conversations, you need to
install the exercism command line client. The exercism command line client is the all-in-one tool for fetching
and submitting code.  Exercism provides a launching point for this to occur. Here's how it works:

1. You fetch some challenges in the form of README documents. These include associated test suites.
2. Then write code in order to make the tests pass.
3. Submit the code and begin the conversation with others.

By repeating this process you will:

* Share while discussing how YOU solved the problem.
* Learn from others as you discover how they solved the same problem.
* Gain experience through repeated practice solving problems.

    <releaseNotes>
#### Patch Release -- Bug Fixes and Improvements ####

----------

A couple of bug fixes and improvements to the user experience have been made to the CLI.

* `unsubmit` command will let the user know that it does not take any arguments if arguments are given.
* Error messages from `upgrade` command have been improved along with a longer timeout for upgrade.
* `-v` global flag has been removed as it was never working as intended. We've also fixed the `-verbose` output.
* Paths in the configuration file will now be absolute paths only.

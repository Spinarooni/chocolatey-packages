    <description>
Exercism is all about having conversations about code. In order to start having those conversations, you need to
install the exercism command line client. The exercism command line client is the all-in-one tool for fetching
and submitting code.  Exercism provides a launching point for this to occur. Here's how it works:

1. You fetch some challenges in the form of README documents. These include associated test suites.
2. Then write code in order to make the tests pass.
3. Submit the code and begin the conversation with others.

By repeating this process you will:

* Share while discussing how YOU solved the problem.
* Learn from others as you discover how they solved the same problem.
* Gain experience through repeated practice solving problems.

    <releaseNotes>
This release adds two new commands:

* exercism list $LANGUAGE to display available exercises
* exercism open $LANGUAGE $PROBLEM to open the most recent iteration of the give problem in the browser.
* It also adds host connectivity status to both the problems API and the submissions API, to help with tricky troubleshooting issues.

We've finally deleted some legacy stuff:

* We won't read the ~/.exercism.go file. If you want to use that, then set the EXERCISM_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.
* The login/logout commands are gone. Use the exercism configure command.
* The deprecated key names in the config have been removed. If you have trouble authenticating, then reconfigure using the exercism configure command.

There are also a couple of bugfixes:

* Expand '~' in config path to home directory
* Display problems that have not yet been submitted when fetching. This should avoid the support tickets where people are unable to move forward.
